#Challenge 02

On this challenege we will work on the grid we refactor from last challenge and make it scalable. We need to create a function to build a dynamic grid based on the number of columns we want.

### Steps:

1. Copy the code you made from the last challenge
2. Build the necessary mixin to build a dynamic column grid
3. What would you need to build an offset for the columns?

### Recommendations

* Make use of any necessary resource you may know
* Don't forget about variables
* Check out the for directive for SASS
